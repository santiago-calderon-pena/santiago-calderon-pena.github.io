        I specialize in <i>Explainable AI</i> and <i>Computer Vision</i>. In my
        current role as a Software Engineer, I have had the opportunity to train
        and deploy Machine Learning models in production pipelines, leveraging <i
          >Explainable AI (XAI)</i
        > to enhance model interpretability for stakeholders and improve decision-making
        processes. <br /><br />

        In addition, I am conducting research under the supervision of Prof.
        Hana Chockler at <i>King's College London</i>, driven by my passion for
        research and my desire to explore the deep foundations of <i
          >Machine Learning</i
        > through the lens of <i>Explainable AI</i>. My research primarily
        focuses on <i>Computer Vision</i> and <i>Explainable AI</i>, but I am
        also deeply interested in multiple modalities.<br />
        <br />

        As deep learning continues to unlock new possibilities, I am
        increasingly concerned about the growing complexity of models, which
        often leads to a loss of understanding of their inner workings. This
        challenge fuels my passion for <i>Explainable AI</i>. My goal is to
        develop methodologies that gradually demystify the black-box nature of
        these models, improving both their transparency and their real-world
        impact. <br /><br />

      I have a deep admiration for James Clerk Maxwell and his remarkable life.
      One of his greatest achievements, which I consider fundamental to the
      world we live in today, was the unification of electricity and magnetism
      in his equations—now known as Maxwell's equations.
